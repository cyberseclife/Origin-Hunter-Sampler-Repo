# ORIGIN-HUNTER v1.0
### Elite Attack Surface Mapping & WAF-Bypass Suite

**LICENSE:** Proprietary / Commercial  
**PLATFORM:** Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)  
**LANGUAGE:** Go (Statically Linked)


## Program Overview
Origin-Hunter is a surgical reconnaissance engine built to strip away the "Security Theater" of modern Web Application Firewalls. While standard tools rely on basic brute-forcing, Origin-Hunter utilizes live infrastructure fingerprints to expose the "True Origin" servers that targets think are hidden.

** Key Technical Advantages **

**The SSL Sniper:** Automatically extracts Subject Alternative Names (SANs) from live SSL certificates to discover subdomains that never appear in standard wordlists.
**Origin-Match Engine:** Uses a high-fidelity Body_Match(100%) algorithm to identify the raw IP address of the backend server. If a server serves the target’s content without WAF headers, it flags a Critical bypass.
**WAF Fingerprinting:** Native detection for AWS WAF, Cloudflare, and Akamai, providing immediate context on the target's defensive layer.
**The Siege Engine:** Optimized Go-concurrency capable of processing 4.8M+ record wordlists with ultra-stable thread management and zero connection poisoning.
**Zero-Dependency Binary:** Statically linked for Linux; move the binary to your Proxmox lab or a remote VPS and start the hunt instantly.
